Overview:

This project demonstrates the application of various machine learning algorithms to the famous Iris Dataset in the machine learning repository 

The Dataset Contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features each:

1) sepal length
2) sepal width
3) petal length
4) petal width

The goal of the project is to classify the flowers to 3 species

1) Iris-Setosa
2) Iris-Versicolor
3) Iris-Virginica

the project contains duplicates and not null values


To run this project you will need to have Python installed and also have the libraries that are written in the txt file (requirements.txt) installed


Models Implemented
------------------

The machine learning models that have been used are the following:

1) Logistic Regression
2) Support Vector Machine
3) Naive Bayes
4) K-Nearest Neighbors


Models Evaluation and Results:

the metrics that we used to evaluate the models are :

1) accuracy
2) precision
3) recall
4) F1-Score

IMPORTANT NOTE!
the iris.data contains the data of the dataset you to download it and implement it to the notebook so that the notebook can continue
